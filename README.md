# HF_PROJECT
This molecular electronic structure package aims to compute molecular properties at the Retricted Hartree Fock (RHF)
and Unrestricted Hartree Fock (UHF) level of theory.

The electronic molecular wavefunction is here expanded into a lineair combination of (atomic) basis functions called a basis set.
