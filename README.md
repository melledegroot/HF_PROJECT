# HF_PROJECT
This molecular electronic structure package aims to compute molecular properties at the Retricted Hartree Fock (RHF),
and Unrestricted Hartree Fock (UHF) levels of theory. To solve the problem of dealing with many integro differentialequations, the electronic wavefunction can  be expanded into a lineair combination of (atomic) basis functions. Roothaans approach elegantly transformed a mathematical problem into a much more simpeler to solve 
problem. In conclusion, In contrast to the Hartree–Fock equations - which are integro-differential equations - the Roothaan–Hall equations have a matrix-form. Therefore, they can be solved using standard technique. (SourceL ROOTAAN
